# OMCog
This repository contains R scripts and data used for analyzing the association between obesity indicators and cognitive function.
# Contents
- `1-Population-level associations.R`: R script for population-level analyses.
- `2-Molecular convergence.R`: uncovering shared proteomic features and metabolic disturbances
- `3-Mechanistic prediction.R`:modeling CI risk using obesity-linked lipidâ€“protein biomarkers
# Note
As the code is related to other ongoing research papers, only a subset of the core scripts is currently available in the repository. Additional related content and scripts will be gradually organized and released in future versions. We plan to continuously update the repository to ensure that all core code and analysis scripts will be uploaded and shared as they are completed. Please stay tuned for future updates to access a more comprehensive set of code and related documentation.
